# Egeo

EGEO is the open-source component library used to build Stratio's UI. The goals are to reduce the time and complexity of interface building being more productive, improving the experience based in apply the same patterns and visuals across the whole Stratio applications being more consistent, and create a common and unified visual language that helps us to understand each other better laying the foundation for scalable growth.

In this repository, you'll find UI components, services, utilities and our official theme. You can discover more in:

* [egeo-web](https://github.com/Stratio/egeo-web): The official website of Egeo where documentation will be available soon.
* [egeo-starter](https://github.com/Stratio/egeo-starter): A Boilerplate project prepared for work with Egeo 2.x, Angular 4.x, TypeScript, Webpack, Karma, Jasmine and Sass.

npm run test -- -- st-table
```

### How to Build
